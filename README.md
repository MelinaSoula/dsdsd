## Holiday Mode

Holiday Mode allows users to secure their home while they are away. When enabled, the system monitors for any presence or movement and triggers an alarm notification if any unauthorized presence is detected.

The app continuously monitors radar data, displaying the latest measurements and alerting users of any suspicious activity. This ensures that users are always informed about the security status of their home.
